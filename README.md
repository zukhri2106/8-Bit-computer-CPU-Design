## 📦 8-bit Computer CPU Design

This repository contains a complete design of an **8-bit CPU** built **entirely from logic gates** using [Logic Circuit](https://logiccircuit.org/).
The goal is to understand and experiment with computer architecture by designing each CPU component — like the program counter, ALU, registers, instruction memory, and control unit — from scratch.

### ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. **Install Logic Circuit**

   * Go to [https://logiccircuit.org/](https://logiccircuit.org/)
   * Download the latest version for your OS (Windows, Linux)
   * Install following the instructions on the website

2. **Open the project**

   * Launch Logic Circuit
   * Go to **File → Open**
   * Load `main.CircuitProject` to see the full CPU design

3. **Explore the modules**

   * Open circuits inside the `module/` folder to examine or edit individual components

4. **Simulate**

   * Use the simulation controls in Logic Circuit to step through instructions, set inputs, and watch how data flows through the CPU
